### Object Detection Models Review
[Object Detection and Tracking in 2020](https://blog.netcetera.com/object-detection-and-tracking-in-2020-f10fb6ff9af3)

YOLO vs R-CNN/Fast R-CNN/Faster R-CNN is more of an apples to apples comparison (YOLO is an object detector, and Mask R-CNN is for object detection+segmentation).
YOLO is easier to implement due to its single stage architecture. Faster inference times and end-to-end training also means it'll be faster to train.

This post details the *bird's view conversion process* in detection, which uses `getPerspectiveTransform` and `warpPerspective` to transform the region of interest inside predefined four points. Similar approach is also adapted in [Bird's Eye View Transformation](https://nikolasent.github.io/opencv/2017/05/07/Bird's-Eye-View-Transformation.html)
