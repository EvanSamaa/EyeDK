Detection on custom dataset with heatmap

## Code Setup
To run the pipline, simply use "pip install -r requirement.txt" tp install all dependencies, then run run_pipline() in main.py with the path to a video as the input
to run the pipline. The output of the pipline can be found in the ./temp_dir_distance/ folder names

## Literature Resources
### Object Detection Models Review
[Responding to the Controversy about YOLOv5](https://blog.roboflow.ai/yolov4-versus-yolov5/)
This post compare between YOLO4 & YOLO5 performace on inference speed, model size and accuracy. Since paper for YOLO5 is not found, may be a good source for identifying YOLO5 performance in all

[Object Detection and Tracking in 2020](https://blog.netcetera.com/object-detection-and-tracking-in-2020-f10fb6ff9af3)

YOLO vs R-CNN/Fast R-CNN/Faster R-CNN is more of an apples to apples comparison (YOLO is an object detector, and Mask R-CNN is for object detection+segmentation).
YOLO is easier to implement due to its single stage architecture. Faster inference times and end-to-end training also means it'll be faster to train.

This post details the *bird's view conversion process* in detection, which uses `getPerspectiveTransform` and `warpPerspective` to transform the region of interest inside predefined four points. Similar approach is also adapted in [Bird's Eye View Transformation](https://nikolasent.github.io/opencv/2017/05/07/Bird's-Eye-View-Transformation.html)
