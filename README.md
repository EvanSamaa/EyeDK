This post details the *bird's view conversion process* in detection, which uses `getPerspectiveTransform` and `warpPerspective` to transform the region of interest inside predefined four points. Similar approach is also adapted in [Bird's Eye View Transformation](https://nikolasent.github.io/opencv/2017/05/07/Bird's-Eye-View-Transformation.html)
